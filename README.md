## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned and applied it to a lot of stuff such as using the adjacent element selector which helped me select the buttons and apply the selected styling if their respective radio button was selected. I also learned about
the weird default styling of the legend in a fieldset and yeah.

### Continued development

I plan to use this as an inspiration for my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS selector reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php) - This helped me remember the specific selectors I needed.
